# What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com in Your Browser and Press Enter?
Have you ever wondered what magic unfolds the moment you press Enter after typing https://www.google.com into your browser? While the page loads almost instantly, under the hood, a series of complex and fascinating processes are triggered in mere milliseconds. Understanding this workflow not only deepens your appreciation of modern internet architecture but is also a popular interview question for software engineering roles.

Let’s break down what really happens behind the scenes.

1. 🌐 DNS Request – Finding the Server's IP Address
The first step is converting the human-readable domain name www.google.com into a machine-readable IP address.

DNS (Domain Name System) acts like the internet’s phone book.

The browser checks its cache first.

If no cache is found, the request is sent to a DNS resolver (often 8.8.8.8, Google’s public DNS).

The resolver queries:

Root servers

Top-level domain (TLD) servers (e.g., .com)

Authoritative name servers (Google’s)

It receives an A or AAAA record, e.g., 142.250.74.100.

✅ Now, the browser knows where to send the request.

2. 🔒 Firewall – Network Gatekeeper
As the request leaves your machine and travels through the internet, it passes through several firewalls:

Your computer’s local firewall

Your ISP’s firewall

Google’s enterprise-grade firewalls

These firewalls filter traffic, block malicious packets, and protect against threats like DDoS attacks.

3. 🔌 TCP/IP – Establishing a Connection
Your browser establishes a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection with the server’s IP address on port 443, the default for HTTPS.

TCP ensures reliable data transmission via a three-way handshake:

SYN

SYN-ACK

ACK

This happens over the IP (Internet Protocol) layer, ensuring routing between networks.

4. 🔐 HTTPS/SSL/TLS – Securing the Communication
Because we’re accessing https://, the connection must be secure.

The browser initiates a TLS (Transport Layer Security) handshake (modern replacement for SSL).

The server provides an SSL certificate proving it is indeed google.com.

The browser verifies the certificate against trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).

They agree on a shared session key using asymmetric encryption.

All further communication is now encrypted, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.

5. ⚖️ Load Balancer – Distributing the Request
Once inside Google's data center, your request hits a load balancer:

This component distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend servers to avoid overload and increase redundancy.

Google’s load balancers operate in active-active mode, meaning all backend servers handle traffic simultaneously.

Common algorithms used include:

Round Robin

Least Connections

IP Hashing

🧠 Goal: High availability, scalability, and fault tolerance.

6. 🖥️ Web Server – Handling the Request
The load balancer routes your request to a web server, such as NGINX or a custom Google frontend server.

The web server:

Parses the incoming HTTP GET request

Serves static content like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images

For dynamic content, forwards the request to the application server

7. ⚙️ Application Server – Business Logic
If you’re searching or logged in, a backend service is required.

The application server (built in languages like Go, Java, Python) handles:

Search logic

Session management

Authentication

It prepares the correct response based on user input.

8. 🗄️ Database – Storing and Retrieving Data
To fulfill the request, the application server may query a database.

Google uses distributed NoSQL databases like Spanner or BigTable.

Typically, a Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) architecture is used:

Primary handles write operations

Replicas handle read-only requests

This ensures high performance and availability at global scale.

9. 📦 HTTP Response – Back to Your Browser
The final result (a search page or homepage) is returned via the same path:

Application server → Web server → Load balancer → Internet → Browser

The browser receives an HTTP response containing the HTML content and starts rendering.

10. 🧠 Rendering the Page – Displaying Google
Finally, your browser:

Parses the HTML

Requests additional resources (images, fonts, JavaScript)

Constructs the DOM (Document Object Model)

Applies CSS rules

Executes JavaScript

Renders the final page for you to interact with

In a blink, you see www.google.com.
